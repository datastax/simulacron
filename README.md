# Simulacron - An Apache CassandraÂ® Native Protocol Server Simulator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/datastax/simulacron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datastax/simulacron)

A native protocol server simulator that helps facilitate the testing of scenarios that are difficult to reliably
reproduce in driver clients and applications.

Inspired by [Scassandra](https://scassandra.org), simulacron is a pure java implementation with increased
emphasis on testing with many simulated native protocol endpoints.

## Features

* **[Java API](doc/java_api)** - For creating and interacting with simulated Clusters.
* **[Standalone JAR](#getting-started-with-the-standalone-jar)** - HTTP JSON API for creating and interacting with
  clusters.
* **Interactive Documentation** - [Swagger](http://swagger.io)-based doc for exploring and making API calls.
* **Lightweight implementation** - Uses [netty](http://netty.io).  Can spawn many simulated nodes on local ip addresses.
  Simulating multi-thousand node clusters is fast and takes very little system resources.
* **Peer Discovery support for Multiple Drivers** - Responds to discovery queries made by DataStax java, csharp,
  c++, php and python drivers with more to come.  Capability to add support for other drivers if needed.
* **Protocol Version V3+ support** - Uses the [native-protocol][native-protocol] library for encoding/decoding.
* **Activity Logging** - Logs requests by clients for each node.
* **Priming Interface** - Configure node behaviors for handling certain requests.
* **Connection API** - Programmatic accessing and closing of client sockets and simulation of starting, stopping
  nodes in addition to making them unresponsive in various ways.

## Prerequisites

0. Java 8+ - Simulacron is a Java-based application built on Java 8.
1. [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) 3.3+ - For building the project.
2. **MacOS only**:  To be able to define more than a single node cluster, multiple loopback aliases should be added.

   This is not required on Linux or Windows since these are implicitly defined.  The following script will add
   127.0.0.0-127.0.4.255:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   for sub in {0..4}; do
       echo "Opening for 127.0.$sub"
       for i in {0..255}; do sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.$sub.$i up; done
   done
   ```

   Note that this is known to cause temporary increased CPU usage in OS X initially while mDNSResponder acclimates
   itself to the presence of added ip addresses.  This lasts several minutes.

   Also note that on reboot these ip addresses need to be re-added.

## Getting Started with the Standalone Jar

To use simulacron with its included HTTP server, one may use the standalone jar.

Pre-built versions of the standalone jar can be downloaded from the
[releases page](https://github.com/datastax/simulacron/releases).

The jar is executed in the following manner:

```bash
java -jar simulacron-standalone-<VERSION>.jar
```

If you'd like to build simulacron, follow these instructions:

0. Set up your maven settings.xml to use artifactory ([see java-api doc](doc/java_api#getting-simulacron))
1. `mvn package` - Compiles, Tests, and packages the project.  Produces standalone jar in `standalone/target/`
2. `java -jar standalone/target/simulacron-standalone-<VERSION>.jar` -  Runs the standalone app.
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:8187/doc](http://localhost:8187/doc) to access the interactive documentation.

### Usage

```
Usage:
  Options:
    --httpintf, -t
      Interface address to bind HTTP server on
      Default: localhost
    --httpport, -p
      HTTP port to bind on
      Default: 8187
    --ip, -i
      Starting IP address to create simulated C* nodes on
      Default: 127.0.0.1
    --loglevel, -l
      Logging level to use
      Default: INFO
    --verbose, -v
      Whether or not to enable verbose http logging (also enables DEBUG
      logging)
      Default: false
```

## Using the Java API

As simulacron is a java project, it includes a Java API that bypasses the need to use the HTTP interface all together.

See the [Java API User's Guide](doc/java_api) for using this API.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the simulacron project, we would appreciate it!  Please be aware of the
following guidelines.

### Code formatting

We follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). See
https://github.com/google/google-java-format for IDE plugins. The rules are not configurable.

The build will fail if the code is not formatted. To format all files from the command line, run:

```
mvn fmt:format -Dformat.validateOnly=false
```

Some aspects are not covered by the formatter:
* imports: please configure your IDE to follow the guide (no wildcard imports, normal imports
  in ASCII sort order come first, followed by a blank line, followed by static imports in ASCII
  sort order).
* XML files: indent with two spaces and try to respect the column limit of 100 characters.

### GitHub Issues & Pull Requests

This project uses GitHub issues to track requests and ongoing work.  If you have a request, simply
create a GitHub issue.  If you would like to add a feature, create an issue first, or if the issue
already exists, either assign the issue to yourself or add a comment.

For any change you make, please push your branch to this repository and create a pull request.
We will try to review it quickly.

There is an expectation that tests are added for any new functionality or if otherwise applicable.
